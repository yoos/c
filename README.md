# C++

This will be a collection of C++ tidbits I work on as I work to master C++. Why
the sudden desire to program for programming's sake? I applied for and failed
to secure a position as a flight software intern at SpaceX, and I'm determined
to be the best damn C++ programmer they've ever hired when I apply a year from
now.
