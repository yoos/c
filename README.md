# C

This will be a collection of tidbits of code I work on as I work to master
C and C++. Why the sudden desire to program for programming's sake? I applied
for and failed to secure a position as a flight software intern at SpaceX due
to my shaky C++ knowledge, and I'm determined to be the best damn C++
programmer they've ever hired when I reapply a year from now.
